# Sentihood-classification

I built an Aspect-based Sentiment analysis for the [Sentihood](https://github.com/uclmr/jack/tree/master/data/sentihood) dataset. 
The model takes text and the target entity as inputs and predict the aspect as well as the sentiment for each example. During my training I was able to achieve Accuracy of 72.78 and F1 of 42.87 on testing data. My model is most accurate for predicting 'general' aspect.

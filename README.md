# Sentihood-classification

I built an Aspect-based Sentiment analysis for the [Sentihood](https://github.com/uclmr/jack/tree/master/data/sentihood) dataset. 
The model takes text and the target entity as inputs and predict the aspect as well as the sentiment for each example. 


## To run 
```python
python main.py
```
